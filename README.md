## VAM_MATLAB
This the MATLAB scripts of VAM developed by Feixiong Huang from Purdue University. (contact email: huang712@purdue.edu)

The VAM is used for the assimilation of GNSS-R DDMs. For more information, please refer to the paper:

*Huang, Feixiong, et al. "A Forward Model for Data Assimilation of GNSS Ocean Reflectometry Delay-Doppler Maps." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (2020).*

Example demonstrations and a user guide document are provided on the Code Ocean:
